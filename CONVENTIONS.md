# Who you are

Hi, I am a senior software flutter architect with extensive experience in 

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Clean Architecture
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)

My expertise lies in building scalable, 
maintainable, and robust systems by applying strategic and tactical DDD, 
modular architecture, and rigorous testing practices. 

## Repository Overall Architecture

The project adopts a modular package structure, clearly divided into four core layers:

- **Domain Layer** (`packages/domains/`)
- **Application Layer** (`packages/applications/`)
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`packages/infra/`)
- **Presentation Layer** (`packages/presentation/`)

This architecture follows classic Clean Architecture principles, where dependencies flow inward and inner layers are independent of outer layers[1][2][5][9].

## Layer-by-Layer Analysis

### **1. Domain Layer**

The Domain Layer is the core of the application, defining business rules and entities:

- **Entities**: Core business data models, such as:
    - `User`
    - `Post`
    - `Language`
- **Value Objects**:
    - `LoginCredentialsVO`
- **Repository Interfaces**:
    - `AuthRepository`
    - `PostRepository`
    - `ThemeRepository`
    - `LocaleRepository`
    - `SettingRepository`

This layer defines business rules and interfaces, remaining abstract and implementation-agnostic[1][6][12].

---

### **2. Application Layer**

The Application Layer contains use cases and acts as a bridge between the Domain and Infrastructure layers:

- **Use Cases**:
    - Authentication: `LoginUsecase`, `LogoutUsecase`, `IsLoggedInUsecase`
    - Posts: `GetPostsUsecase`, `FindPostByIdUsecase`, `InsertPostUsecase`, etc.
    - Theme: `SetThemeUsecase`, `GetThemeUsecase`
    - Localization: `SetLocaleUsecase`, `GetLocaleUsecase`
- **Mappers**:
    - `PostMapper`
    - `ThemeMapper`
    - `LocaleMapper`
- **DTOs**:
    - `PostDTO`
    - `LoginParamsDTO`
    - `LoginResponseDTO`

Each use case orchestrates a specific business operation, encapsulating business logic and workflow[1][2][6].

---

### **3. Infrastructure Layer**

The Infrastructure Layer provides concrete implementations for domain interfaces and manages external resources:

- **Repository Implementations**:
    - `AuthRepositoryImpl`
    - `PostRepositoryImpl`
    - `ThemeRepositoryImpl`
    - `LocaleRepositoryImpl`
    - `SettingRepositoryImpl`
- **Data Sources**:
    - Remote: API clients (Dio-based)
    - Local: `SharedPreferences`, `Sembast`
- **Network Clients**:
    - `DioClient` (HTTP client)
    - `SupabaseClient`
- **Interceptors**:
    - `AuthInterceptor`
    - `RetryInterceptor`
    - `LoggingInterceptor`
- **Utilities**:
    - Encryption (`xxtea`)
    - Exception handling (`NetworkExceptions`)

This layer handles all external interactions, such as network requests, local storage, and third-party integrations[1][6][12].

---

### **4. Presentation Layer**

The Presentation Layer manages UI and user interaction:

- **Screens**:
    - Authentication: `Login`
    - Content: `Home`, `PostList`, `PostDetail`
- **State Management** (Store pattern, possibly MobX or similar):
    - Stores: `AuthStore`, `PostStore`, `ThemeStore`, `LanguageStore`
    - State Objects: `AuthState`, `ThemeState`
- **Widgets**:
    - `RoundedButtonWidget`
    - `TextfieldWidget`
    - `ProgressIndicatorWidget`
    - `ErrorDisplayWidget`
- **Navigation**:
    - `NavigationService`
    - `AppRouter`

UI logic, state management, and navigation are handled here, separated from business and data logic[1][6][15].

---

### **5. Dependency Injection & Cross-Layer Services**

- **Dependency Injection**:
    - Central container: `service_locator.dart`
    - Dedicated modules per layer
- **Logging System**:
    - Multi-level logging (`LogLevel`)
    - Multiple outputs (console, file, Crashlytics, etc.)
    - Formatters
- **Error Handling**:
    - `GlobalErrorListener`
    - `ErrorParser`
    - `ApiHandlingCubit` extensions

---

## Architectural Advantages

- **High Cohesion & Low Coupling**: Each layer has clear responsibilities, reducing interdependencies[1][6][9].
- **Testability**: Interfaces and dependency injection facilitate unit and integration testing[1][6].
- **Maintainability**: Modular design makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend[1][5].
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data access are clearly separated[1][2][6].
- **Replaceability**: Infrastructure implementations can be swapped without affecting business logic[1][6][12].


# Recommended Implementation Steps


## Key Principles

- **Always clarify requirements and terminology before moving to the next step.** If there is any ambiguity, ask questions until everything is clear.
- **Separate concerns strictly:** Domain logic, application orchestration, infrastructure, and presentation must each reside in their own layer.
- **Iterate and refine:** Both DDD and TDD are iterative processes. Expect to revisit and improve models and tests as understanding deepens[1][5].
- **Collaborate:** Frequent communication with domain experts is essential to ensure the model remains aligned with real-world needs[1][2][5].
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todoâ€™s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
